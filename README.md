# cest-mrf-image-recon
This repository is designed to help users perform quantitative **chemical exchange saturation transfer (CEST)** imaging using **magnetic resonance fingerprinting (MRF)**. It contains the following files:

1. Bruker ParaVision method files for acquiring CEST-MRF images on a Bruker preclinical scanner;
2. MATLAB code for interactive processing of study data including CEST-MRF imaging; and
3. Python code that interfaces the MATLAB processing pipeline with the Bloch-McConnell simulation developed by the Momentum Laboratory at Tel Aviv University (https://github.com/momentum-laboratory/molecular-mrf)

# Questions and Support
